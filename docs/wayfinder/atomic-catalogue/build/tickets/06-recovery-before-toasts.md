## Goal

Move the two recoveries that live only in toasts before the toasts go ([ticket 09, item 1](../../tickets/09-grill-toast-replacements.md#resolution-2026-10-25)); research: `git show origin/research/ac-03-toasts-and-explainers:docs/wayfinder/atomic-catalogue/research/03-toasts-and-explainers.md`, "Undo and recovery".

## Decided behaviour

- **GitHub not answering:** the failed page or Files panel itself shows **Try again** (today only the toast from `src/github-reads.ts:80` / `src/read-retry.ts` has it).
- **Media Replace:** its Undo is reachable outside the modal dialog, on the tile or detail picture (`src/page-builder/media-library-replace.ts:128`); the top-bar Undo also takes it back once the dialog closes.
- No new toast or explainer text.

## Files

- `src/github-reads.ts`, `src/read-retry.ts`, the failed-state view of the page and Files panel, `src/page-builder/media-library-replace.ts` and its detail view; tests.

## Done when

- A spec: GitHub stops answering, the failed screen shows Try again, pressing it reloads.
- A spec: Replace in Media, close the dialog, Undo restores the old picture.

## Kit commands and evidence

Agent Kit is required (`scripts/agents/kit`; [runner.md](../../../../agents/runner.md)). `kit bg slice-ac-06 -- scripts/agents/kit slice --ticket <this ticket> --builder claude-opus-5-5`; `kit wait job slice-ac-06 --timeout 2h`.

- `kit unit --affected`, `kit specs --affected` and `npm run check` green, with `RESULT:` lines quoted in Done.
- `kit size` against dev: boot bytes unchanged or lower.
- `kit shots --compare dev` of the touched screens, light and dark, 390 and 1280 wide (Lex sees the contact sheet); Opus UX review against the [UX rulebook](../../../../agents/ux-rulebook.md).
- The one-offs count (slice 04, once landed) does not rise; quote its `RESULT:` line.
