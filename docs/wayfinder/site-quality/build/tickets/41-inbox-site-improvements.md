## Goal

The things only the user can supply, found on every page, not only the open one ([ticket 05](../../tickets/05-grill-automatic-fixes.md#resolution-2026-10-26); the words rules in research 01). Size: M–L.

## Decided behaviour

- Items: a picture without a description (wave-off: Decorative, writing the markup the Media manager writes today), a page without a title, a link or button with no name, a vague link word ("read more"), a skipped heading level (with today's one-press fix), a video without subtitles (wave-off: No speech).
- Found by the same checks the edit bar runs today (`src/controllers/page-structure-controller.ts`), run over all pages from the drafts and the repository, in the background, after load and after each change.
- **One list (DRY):** the checks move into the shared rule module `shared/site-score/` (slice 11), so the Inbox, the score rings (63) and page details (64) show the same findings.
- Missing descriptions are not items (slice 22 writes them).
- Privacy page and security contact are not items yet (map: not yet specified).

## Files

Expected: `src/inbox/site-checks.ts`, `shared/site-score/` (the checks), `src/controllers/page-structure-controller.ts` (shared checks moved, not copied), tests.

## Done when

- A fixture site with one of each problem on different pages lists each once, with the right spot; fixing one removes it.
- The matching `kit site-rules` "needs words" rules are reported, not failed.

## Kit commands and evidence

Agent Kit is required (`scripts/agents/kit`; [runner.md](../../../../agents/runner.md)). `kit doctor` first, then `kit bg slice-sq-41 -- scripts/agents/kit slice --ticket <this ticket> --builder claude-opus-5-5`; `kit wait job slice-sq-41 --timeout 2h`.

- `kit unit --affected`, `kit specs --affected` and `npm run check` green, with `RESULT:` lines quoted in Done.
- `kit size` against dev: boot bytes unchanged or lower.
- `kit lighthouse` (with `kit site-rules`) on the new and edited site, `RESULT:` lines quoted in Done.
- `kit shots` of the touched screens, light and dark, 390 and 1280 wide (Lex sees the contact sheet); Opus UX review of the sheet against the [UX rulebook](../../../../agents/ux-rulebook.md).
- `kit review`, then `kit pr` into `dev`. A kit command that cannot run is named in `decide`, never skipped silently.

## Done (2026-11-14)

First part, built with [slice 40](40-inbox.md) as Orbit card TOOLS-222. The ticket stays open for the rest.

- Built: a picture without a description (wave-off Decorative, only for pictures stored in the site; Lex, 2026-11-14) and a page without a title, found on every page from the drafts and the repository once the site's text index has read them all, and again after each change. Each is listed once per page with its spot: the picture selected with the edit bar on its alt text, or the page's Page settings.
- The picture's verdict is the edit bar's own (`placeState` from the Media rules, handed in), so the Inbox and the edit bar never disagree; the checks are in `src/inbox/site-items.ts` (pure, `tests/inbox-site-items.test.ts`).
- Not built yet (follow-ups): a link or button with no name, a vague link word, a skipped heading level, a video without subtitles (No speech); moving the checks into `shared/site-score/` for the score rings (63) and page details (64); reporting the matching `kit site-rules` "needs words" rules.
