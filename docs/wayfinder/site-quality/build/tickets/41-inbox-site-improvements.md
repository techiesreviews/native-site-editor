## Goal

The things only the user can supply, found on every page, not only the open one ([ticket 05](../../tickets/05-grill-automatic-fixes.md#resolution-2026-10-26); the words rules in research 01). Size: M–L.

## Decided behaviour

- Items: a picture without a description (wave-off: Decorative, writing the markup the Media manager writes today), a page without a title, a link or button with no name, a vague link word ("read more"), a skipped heading level (with today's one-press fix), a video without subtitles (wave-off: No speech).
- Found by the same checks the edit bar runs today (`src/controllers/page-structure-controller.ts`), run over all pages from the drafts and the repository, in the background, after load and after each change.
- **One list (DRY):** the checks move into the shared rule module `shared/site-score/` (slice 11), so the Inbox, the score rings (63) and page details (64) show the same findings.
- Missing descriptions are not items (slice 22 writes them).
- Privacy page and security contact are not items yet (map: not yet specified).

## Files

Expected: `src/inbox/site-checks.ts`, `shared/site-score/` (the checks), `src/controllers/page-structure-controller.ts` (shared checks moved, not copied), tests.

## Done when

- A fixture site with one of each problem on different pages lists each once, with the right spot; fixing one removes it.
- The matching `kit site-rules` "needs words" rules are reported, not failed.

## Kit commands and evidence

Agent Kit is required (`scripts/agents/kit`; [runner.md](../../../../agents/runner.md)). `kit doctor` first, then `kit bg slice-sq-41 -- scripts/agents/kit slice --ticket <this ticket> --builder claude-opus-5-5`; `kit wait job slice-sq-41 --timeout 2h`.

- `kit unit --affected`, `kit specs --affected` and `npm run check` green, with `RESULT:` lines quoted in Done.
- `kit size` against dev: boot bytes unchanged or lower.
- `kit lighthouse` (with `kit site-rules`) on the new and edited site, `RESULT:` lines quoted in Done.
- `kit shots` of the touched screens, light and dark, 390 and 1280 wide (Lex sees the contact sheet); Opus UX review of the sheet against the [UX rulebook](../../../../agents/ux-rulebook.md).
- `kit review`, then `kit pr` into `dev`. A kit command that cannot run is named in `decide`, never skipped silently.
